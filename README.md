# :movie_camera: Movie Streaming Guide
Final project for `CS161: Introduction to Computer Science I` at Oregon State University. It has been approved for public sharing.

This project simulates a movie streaming guide that allows users to:

- Add and remove movies from streaming service catalogs
- Manage multiple streaming platforms
- Search for where a specific movie is available to stream

It consists of three main classes:

- `Movie`: Represents a movie with attributes title, genre, director, and release year
- `StreamingService`: Represents a platform (e.g., Netflix, Hulu) with a catalog of available movies
- `StreamingGuide`: A central guide that tracks all streaming services and can find which services stream a select movie

The project demonstrates class-based design, object composition, and encapsulation using private attributes and getter methods.
